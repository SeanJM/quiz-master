# A pretty decent scaffold

This is starting to get to a pretty state of the art place.

## What's included?

- A Webpack configuration designed to grow (webpack-merge)
- Babel tranformation of latest JavaScript to ES5 for browser compatibility
- ESLint (JavaScript code linting)
- SASS
- Hot module replacement (Automatic reloading of the page when files change)
- Souce control with Git
- Single source of truth state pattern
- Component based architecture
- Hyperscript node creation

## Future

The next steps are 

- Lazy copying / merging of objects
- JSX
- React or Vue or Angular.
- TypeScript

## What text editor to use?

- Visual Studio Code
- Sublime Text

## How to start this?

Install NodeJS if you haven't already. In the command line, run `npm i`

For eslint you will want to install it globally: I don't know what that is in windows, but in a mac that's `sudo npm i eslint`
